- **Teacher**: Volodymyr Boublik

## Notes

- `main.cpp` is **simple** and demonstrates project functionality

- About **VideoFramework**:
  - It compiles
  - No mistakes in memory usage
  - No mistakes in architecture\
_It is all that we need to know about framework, because its implementation is not neccessary for presentation of Facade design pattern_

- About **VideoConverter**:
  - Implemented **simple** method `convertVideo`, which **properly** encapsulate library usage from user into Facade.
  - Singleton implementation is **clear**

- About **CatTubeAccount**:
  - **No questions** for realization
  - **Simple** example of using facade from client

## Summary

- CatTube app **well** demonstrates **Facade** design pattern and have no problems

- My **grade** for this demonstration **10\10**
